# 🐄 Animal Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning

A machine learning–based mobile application that predicts animal diseases from symptoms using the **Random Forest algorithm** and provides preventive measures and veterinary assistance. This project is designed especially to support farmers and animal caretakers in rural and semi-urban areas.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

Animal diseases significantly affect livestock productivity and farmer livelihoods. Due to limited access to veterinary specialists, early diagnosis is often missed. This project addresses the problem by providing an **intelligent decision support system** that predicts animal diseases based on user-entered symptoms.

The system uses **supervised machine learning (Random Forest)** trained on disease–symptom datasets and delivers accurate predictions through a user-friendly Android application.

## 🧠 How It Works

1. User logs in using mobile number (OTP verification)
2. Selects animal type and breed
3. Enters observed symptoms
4. Symptoms are processed by the trained Random Forest model
5. System predicts:
   - Possible disease  
   - Disease information  
   - Preventive measures  
   - Help options
